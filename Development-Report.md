## Product Vision
Our vision is to help users navigate the conference building by guiding them from their current location to relevant spots in the conference

## Elevator Pitch
We started this project because we understand how hard it is to find our way in a conference building we have never been in. So why would you find your way when SimplyFind can do it for you? If you need to go somewhere and have no idea how to, just a couple of taps will make sure you go where you need to without ever getting you lost.

## Requirements

### User stories

+ As a person with no sense of direction, I would like to have very precise directions to not get lost in the building.

+ As a forgetful person, I would like to know what conferences are going on today because I want a simple way to get this information.

+ As a coffee drinker, I would like to know where the coffee machines are, because I don't want to be dependent on the coffee breaks.

+ As a participant, I would want to know where I could do check-in as soon as I arrived, so I wouldn't have to ask.

+ As a FEUP student, I'm interested in knowing where the coffee breaks are, and which speakers will be talking at what time because I already know how to find my way at FEUP.

+ As an user, I would like to know where my colleagues are if i get lost.

+ As a speaker, I would like to know the rooms where I am going to give a talk because those are the relevant locations for me.

### User stories

+ As a coffee drinker, I would like to know where the coffee machines are, because I don't want to be dependent on the coffee breaks.

+ As a forgetful person, I would like to know what conferences are going on today because I wanted a simple way to get this information.

+ As a foreigner I would like to locate myself within FEUP because I was never here before.

+ As a person with no sense of direction, I would like to have very precise directions to not get lost in the building.

+ As a participant, I would want to know where I could do check-in as soon as I arrived, so I wouldn't have to ask.

+ As a disabled person, I wish I could see a map photo of the rooms or know the distance of the rooms because I want to know the closest owns to where I am.

+ If I get lost, I would like to know where my colleagues are, to find them when that happens.

+ As a speaker, I would like to know the rooms where I am going to give a talk because those are the relevant locations for me.

+ As a FEUP student, I'm interested in knowing where the coffee breaks are, and which speakers will be talking at what time because I already know how to find my way at FEUP.
